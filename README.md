# UNOnoMercy-multiplayer

UnoNoMercy** is a collaborative project that reimagines the classic UNO game with a merciless twist.

Designed for friends to play  **online from anywhere** , it removes all barriers — no accounts, no external platforms, no complications — just quick matches and ruthless fun.

The goal is to create a simple, accessible, and chaotic multiplayer experience where:

* 💥 Special “No Mercy” rules amplify revenge and unpredictability
* 🌐 Players can host or join matches online (client-host or server model TBD)
* 🎨 The interface stays minimal and fast, focused purely on gameplay
* 🤝 Entirely open-source and developed collaboratively among friends

Whether you’re a strategist or an agent of chaos, UnoNoMercy has one rule: *don’t hold back.*
